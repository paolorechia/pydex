## Using pydex for the first time.


1. Select a block of code with your text editor.
2. Either right click on the block with your mouse or press `Ctrl-Shift-P`.
3. Choose the pydex command (or type it if you used `Ctrl-Shift-P`).
4. The first time you invoke the command, the extension will ask you for a token. To get this token, you must sign up at https://signup.codex.openimagegenius.com/signup (it's free!)
5. Paste this token into the dialog that the extension shows you.
6. Now you can go ahead and execute pydex commands again like you just did the first time, except it shouldn't ask for the token again.
7. Errors when communciating with the API should trigger an error window notification.

Enjoy it!
